Application Setup Guide
Getting started with Habanero is blazingly fast! Follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the Development Server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Setup .env

Before running the project you need to create a `.env` file in the root of the
repository. You can copy the file `.env.sample` and rename it to
`.env`.

## Final Consideration:

In the development of the Habanero project the supplier details page's update
feature faced a hurdle due to backend restrictions disallowing PUT methods.
